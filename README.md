The goal is to develop a classifier capable to automatically map every vector into its class: 

• The classification approach is based on Gaussian Discriminant Functions
• The approach makes an assumption that the features are statistically independent given the class
• The results are reported in terms of error rate, the percentage of times the approach maps a  vector into the wrong class.
